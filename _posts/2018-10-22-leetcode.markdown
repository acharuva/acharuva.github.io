## Learning from LeetCode

### [832. Flipping an Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/description/)
[solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/solution/)

        My solution was long. Learned two tricks 
            - indexing from end arr[~i]
            - inverting binary digits using XOR x^i


Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

### [414. Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/description/)
[Good solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/discuss/183105/Python3-solution-beats-100)


        My solution was long. With simple initialization the program could be shortened.

### [852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/description/)

        I usually have trouble with shrinking indexing of this kind.
